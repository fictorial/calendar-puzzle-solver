    <h1>Calendar Puzzle Solver</h1>

    <p>
        The goal of this puzzle is to place all 8 pieces together on the board
        such that all squares of the board are covered except a single month and a single
        day thereof.  Repeat daily.
    </p>
    <p>
        I became curious about how one might automatically solve for all dates and, well,
        here we are. A simple algorithm finds all solutions (there are 1000s) in less than
        10 minutes. One solution per date is here included.
